# Trading Control
A Rimworld Mod, hosted on the Workshop[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007107588]


### What it does.
This allows you to designate where you want Trade Caravans and Guests to set up shop, then lets you tell the Traders when to move on!

No more trampling around inside your workshops or through your bedrooms in the middle of the night!

### Bonus
- You can now dismiss traders early by selecting one of your colonists and right clicking on the main trader, then choosing the "Dismiss Trader" option!

## Save Compatible
Freely add and remove it whenever you need to.
